## 0. Plain-language summary (for anyone, not just developers)

**Before this session:** JanVaani let a citizen submit a complaint (text, voice, or photo) and an MP could see a basic list of complaints for their constituency, plus a single priority score based on education data.

**After this session:** it works the same way for a citizen, but the MP now gets a much richer, AI-assisted decision dashboard, and two real bugs were fixed that were silently losing data. Nothing about *how a citizen submits a complaint* changed — all the new screens are on the MP side.

### What a citizen sees differently
Nothing new to look at — but two things now work that were silently broken before:
- **Recording a voice complaint and submitting without typing anything** used to save with a blank description. It now gets automatically transcribed, so it actually shows up with real text.
- **Uploading a photo without typing anything** used to do the same — save blank. It now gets a one-line AI description of what's in the photo.

### What an MP sees differently (all on the `/dashboard` page)
1. **A hamburger menu (☰) in the top corner** — wasn't there before. It opens one new page: **"Update gov data"**, where an MP can upload an Excel/CSV/PDF file of government statistics, or pull data directly from a data.gov.in link. An AI reads the file, figures out what it is, and shows whether it trusts the data enough to save it.
2. **"Linked issues" section (new)** — if several different complaints (say, a school complaint, a bus complaint, and a road complaint) are coming from the same area, this section says so, with a plain-English guess at the shared cause and a confidence percentage.
3. **A live map (new)** — every complaint that has a location now shows as a coloured dot on a map of the constituency, so an MP can see clusters/hotspots visually instead of reading a list.
4. **A badge on every complaint** reading something like "Strong evidence · 87%" or "Weak evidence · 20%" — this tells the MP how much independent confirmation a complaint has (photo evidence, GPS, other similar complaints, government records), so obviously-thin complaints don't get the same weight as well-corroborated ones.
5. **The "Priority evidence" score at the top** is smarter now — it used to only look at education statistics; now it also factors in whatever other government data (health, roads, water, etc.) the MP has uploaded, wherever it's corroborated by real citizen complaints.

### What changed that nobody will ever see, but matters
- Two backend endpoints (a way to list *all* complaints in the system) had **no login check at all** — anyone who found the web address could read every citizen's complaints. That's now locked to the MP who owns that constituency.
- Every complaint's audio recording and photo were sitting on a **permanently public web link** — anyone with the link, forever, could open them. Those links are now locked down; the app still shows them to the MP, but through a link that expires after an hour.

## 2. Built in this session

### 2.1 Gov-data upload pipeline (new capability)
MP dashboard hamburger menu → **"Update gov data"** → upload Excel/CSV/PDF, or pull directly from a data.gov.in API resource. Runs through a 3-step AI pipeline (Gemini schema/category detection → data-quality check → plain-language summary), with a confidence threshold deciding commit vs. "needs review" — Python decides, AI only proposes.

**New files:**
- `backend/app/parsers.py` — Excel/CSV/PDF → rows
- `backend/app/api/gov_data.py` — `/gov-data/upload`, `/gov-data/import-api`, `/gov-data/imports`
- `backend/app/models/gov_data_import.py` — `GovDataImport` (audit trail) + `GovDataRecord` (normalized rows)
- `backend/app/schemas/gov_data.py`
- `backend/alembic/versions/c1a2b3d4e5f6_add_gov_data_imports_and_records.py`
- `src/app/gov-data/page.tsx` — MP upload UI + import history

### 2.2 Voice & photo AI (bug fix + new capability)
**Found and fixed a real bug:** voice-mode and photo-only complaint submissions were being stored with **empty text** — the MP dashboard showed nothing for them.

- `backend/app/gemini_client.py` — `transcribe_audio()` (Gemini audio understanding, not a separate Speech-to-Text call) and `analyze_photo()` (Gemini vision, returns description + confidence + issue_visible)
- `backend/app/api/complaints.py` — wires both into `create_complaint()`; failures never block submission

### 2.3 Complaint Verification Score (Trust + Explainability)
Every complaint now gets a **Strong / Moderate / Weak** evidence badge, computed from independent signals — never AI-invented:
- Photo AI confidence (if a photo was attached)
- GPS presence
- Count of other complaints in the same category/constituency (last 90 days)
- MP-uploaded government data corroboration (same category, same district)

**New file:** `backend/app/verification.py`
**Modified:** `backend/app/models/complaint.py`, `backend/app/schemas/complaint.py` (added `verification_confidence`, `verification_status`, `verification_reasons`)
**Migration:** `backend/alembic/versions/d2e3f4a5b6c7_add_verification_fields_to_complaints.py`

### 2.4 Google Maps Hotspot Map
All of an MP's constituency complaints plotted on a map, category-colour-coded markers, click for details.

- `src/components/HotspotMap.tsx` — loads Google Maps JS API via a plain `<script>` tag (no npm package)
- `src/types/google-maps.d.ts` — minimal ambient types for the above
- `backend/app/schemas/dashboard.py` / `backend/app/api/dashboard.py` — new `map_points` field on `/dashboard/summary`

### 2.5 Community Consensus Graph ("Linked issues")
Groups nearby complaints across **different** categories (GPS-grid bucketed, pure Python) and asks Gemini whether they plausibly share one root cause — a hypothesis with a confidence score, never a stored fact.

- `backend/app/consensus.py`
- `backend/app/api/dashboard.py` — new `GET /dashboard/consensus`
- Dashboard "Linked issues" section

### 2.6 Evidence engine upgrade
`backend/app/evidence.py` now also scores MP-uploaded gov-data (health/roads/water/etc., not just education) — but only when citizen complaints in the same district independently corroborate the same category. No invented thresholds for unfamiliar metrics.

### 2.7 New `/dashboard` API + full dashboard UI
- `backend/app/api/dashboard.py`, `backend/app/schemas/dashboard.py` (new — not in last commit)
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — KPIs, Priority evidence, Linked issues, Hotspot map, Themes, Recent submissions (with verification badges), hamburger menu

### 2.8 Security hardening
- **Firebase App Check** wired in (`backend/app/app_check.py`, `src/lib/firebase.ts`) — soft-gated behind `ENFORCE_APP_CHECK` env flag, safe default off
- **Secrets audit**: confirmed no committed secrets/keys anywhere in the repo; `GOV_DATA_API_KEY` was missing from the Secret Manager wiring in `backend/main.py` — fixed
- **Storage lockdown** (the big one): `storage.rules` previously allowed `allow read: if true` on all complaint media (audio/photos) — **publicly and permanently readable by anyone with a URL**. Now `allow read: if false`; the backend mints short-lived (60 min) signed URLs on demand via the Admin SDK, which bypasses Security Rules. New file: `backend/app/media.py`. **This has been deployed** (`firebase deploy --only storage`) and verified: direct public access now returns 403; signed URLs return 200.
- **Fixed an unauthenticated public endpoint**: `GET /complaints` and `GET /complaints/{id}` had **no auth at all** — anyone could list every citizen's complaints, including media URLs. Now require MP auth, scoped to the requesting MP's own constituency.
- `backend/app/gemini_client.py` — `transcribe_audio`/`analyze_photo` now fetch media via the Admin SDK (`app/media.py`) instead of a plain public HTTPS fetch, since the URLs they read are no longer publicly reachable either.

### 2.9 Demo data tooling
- `backend/scripts/seed_demo_data.py` — generates N realistic complaints (categories, GPS hotspots, growth-skewed dates) for a given constituency, makes **zero Gemini calls** (verification scores computed in-memory). Supports `--delete` to cleanly remove only seeded rows (identified by `user_id IS NULL`, which real complaints never have).
- Used to seed 5000 demo complaints for constituency "Test Constituency", then verified against the live MP dashboard.

## 4. Infrastructure actions already performed (not just code)

- ✅ `alembic upgrade head` run against the live Cloud SQL database (added `gov_data_imports`, `gov_data_records` tables + verification columns to `complaints`)
- ✅ `GOV_DATA_API_KEY` secret confirmed to exist in Google Secret Manager
- ✅ `backend/.env`'s `DATABASE_URL` password corrected (fetched fresh from Secret Manager)
- ✅ New `storage.rules` deployed to Firebase (`firebase deploy --only storage`) — verified live (403 on public access, 200 on signed URLs)
- ✅ 5000 demo complaints seeded for "Test Constituency", verified live on the MP dashboard
- ✅ `roles/aiplatform.user` granted to `princeojha436@gmail.com` on `vipasana-499205`

## 5. Outstanding / not yet done

- ❌ **`roles/aiplatform.user` NOT yet granted to `itsvineetwork@gmail.com`** — this is the actual Application Default Credentials identity used for local Gemini calls; without it, every Gemini call from this machine fails with `403 PERMISSION_DENIED`. Run:
  ```
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding vipasana-499205 --member="user:itsvineetwork@gmail.com" --role="roles/aiplatform.user"
  ```
- ✅ ~~Nothing in this session has been `git commit`-ed~~ — committed 2026-07-08 in three commits (backend status workflow/notifications/ranked-issues, frontend dashboard features, roadmap doc)
- ⏸️ **App Check — DEFERRED (2026-07-08, user decision).** `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` is empty in `.env.local`; the web app was never registered for App Check (reCAPTCHA Enterprise API not enabled on the project either). `ENFORCE_APP_CHECK` must stay **off** in production until a site key exists AND a frontend build carrying it is deployed — enabling it earlier would 401 every live submission. The Maps key exists in `.env.local` and gets baked into Hosting builds from this machine; deliberately NOT committed to `.env.production` because both GitHub remotes are public repos.
- ⏸️ **Service Account Token Creator — verified NOT granted, grant DEFERRED (2026-07-08, user decision).** The `api` function runs as `1044819117404-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`; its SA-level IAM policy is empty and `roles/editor` does not include `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob`. The `serviceAccountKey.json` fallback (`GCP_CREDENTIALS_PATH`) is excluded from function deploys by `firebase.json`, so in production `generate_signed_url()` fails and `media.signed_url()` returns `None` — media links are null in prod until the grant is made:
  ```
  gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding 1044819117404-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com --member="serviceAccount:1044819117404-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator" --project=vipasana-499205
  ```
- ⏸️ **Demo data cleanup — attempted 2026-07-08, blocked, DEFERRED (user decision).** This machine's public IP rotated to `49.36.136.255` but Cloud SQL only authorizes the stale `49.36.176.160/32`, so the delete script can't connect. To run it later: refresh the authorized network, then `python scripts/seed_demo_data.py --constituency "Test Constituency" --delete`. (Same blocker applies to running Alembic migrations from this machine — note the two NEW migrations committed 2026-07-08, `a1b2c3d4e5f7` + `b2c3d4e5f6a8`, are NOT yet applied to the live DB; the backend must not be redeployed before they run.)
- ❌ FCM push notifications (discussed, not built)

## 6. Does this actually solve a real problem for the MP? (in plain language)

An MP's real problem isn't "too few complaints" — it's the opposite: **too many complaints, no way to tell which ones are real and which ones matter most.** Everything below is about closing that gap honestly, without the app just guessing and sounding confident.

### The core rule this whole system follows
**The AI is never allowed to invent a priority, a score, or a "this matters" decision out of thin air.** Every number the MP sees must be traceable back to something real — a count of complaints, a government record, a photo, a location. The AI's only job is to *read* things (a voice note, a photo, a messy spreadsheet) and to *explain* a number in plain English — never to decide the number itself. That decision is always made by a fixed, readable set of rules.

### How "is this complaint even real?" gets answered
Instead of trusting every complaint equally, each one is checked against evidence that has nothing to do with what the citizen typed:
- Was there a photo, and does it actually show a real problem (not a blank/random image)?
- Was a location attached (GPS), or is it just a name typed in?
- Have other people, independently, complained about the same thing in the same area recently?
- Does the government's own data (the files/records an MP has uploaded) back up that this is a known issue in that area?

The more of these that line up, the higher the confidence shown to the MP ("Strong evidence" vs "Weak evidence"). A single unverifiable text complaint will never be shown with the same confidence as ten photo-and-GPS-backed complaints from the same street.

### How "which problem matters most" gets answered
The system doesn't just count complaints — it looks for **patterns that are more convincing than an individual complaint**:
- **Is it getting worse over time**, or is it a one-off? (a sudden spike in complaints about one thing is more urgent than a steady trickle)
- **Are different-looking complaints actually the same underlying issue?** (a school complaint, a bus complaint, and a road complaint from the same area might really be "there's no proper road to that area" — the system looks for this and says so, as a guess with a confidence number, never as a stated fact)
- **Does government data already confirm the gap?** (e.g. official records already show only one school for a large population — that's a much stronger basis for a decision than complaints alone)

### Why raw numbers aren't enough, and what's still missing
A number like "89% pass rate" or "42 complaints" means very little by itself — it only becomes useful compared to something: last year, a nearby area, or a state average. Right now the system does this partially (it does track "complaints are rising 40% this month," for example) but does **not yet** compare one area's government data against similar areas elsewhere — that's the single biggest improvement still on the table, because it would turn plain numbers into meaningful ones.

The other honest gap: the system currently has no way of checking whether its own recommendations actually worked. It can say "this is the top priority" — but nothing yet records whether the MP acted on it, or whether the problem was genuinely resolved afterward. Without that feedback loop, this is a strong "here's the most defensible way to prioritize a big pile of complaints" tool — but it cannot yet claim to have proven it solves problems in the real world. That would need to be tracked over months, not something a hackathon build can show on day one.
